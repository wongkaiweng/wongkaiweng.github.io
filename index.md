I am currently a roboticist at [Iron Ox](http://ironox.com/).

I received my Ph.D. in 2018 at Cornell University, where I was advised by Prof. [Hadas Kress-Gazit](http://verifiablerobotics.com/). I was affiliated with the [Autonomous Systems Lab](http://cornell-asl.org/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page) and the [LTLMoP](http://ltlmop.github.io/) Project then. I was also one of the [2017 Commercialization Fellows](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/students/graduate-students/phd-students/phd-commercialization-fellows/meet-2017-commercialization) at Cornell. My research tackled failure that arises during the deployment of robot controllers, ranging from offline preventive measures to online replanning.
