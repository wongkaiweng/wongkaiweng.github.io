I am currently a roboticist at [Aescape](https://www.aescape.co/).
I focus on motion planning for mobile robots and robot arms.
I have worked with custom and commercial robots throughout my career and explored areas such as perception and localization.

I received my Ph.D. in 2018 from Cornell University,
where I was advised by Prof. [Hadas Kress-Gazit](http://verifiablerobotics.com/).
My research tackled failure that arises during the deployment of robot controllers,
ranging from offline preventive measures to online replanning.
