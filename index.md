I am an experienced roboticist specializing in motion planning for mobile platforms and robotic arms.
My career has been defined by bridging the gap between theoretical planning and real-world deployment, working across the stack from perception and localization to custom hardware integration.

I earned my Ph.D. in 2018 from Cornell University under the guidance of Prof. [Hadas Kress-Gazit](http://verifiablerobotics.com/).
My research focused on the reliability of robot controllers, 
developing strategies for offline prevention and real-time online replanning to mitigate deployment failures.

*I am currently on sabbatical, exploring new perspectives in the field.*
