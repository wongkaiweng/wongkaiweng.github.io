I am a roboticist with a focus on motion planning for mobile robots and robot arms.
I have worked with custom and commercial robots throughout my career and explored areas such as perception and localization.

I am currently with [Auris Health](https://www.aurishealth.com/).
I was a roboticist at [Iron Ox](https://ironox.com/).
Before then, I received my Ph.D. in 2018 at Cornell University,
where I was advised by Prof. [Hadas Kress-Gazit](http://verifiablerobotics.com/).
I was affiliated with the [Autonomous Systems Lab](http://cornell-asl.org/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page) and the [LTLMoP](http://ltlmop.github.io/) Project then.
I was also one of the [2017 Commercialization Fellows](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/students/graduate-students/phd-students/phd-commercialization-fellowship/meet-2017) at Cornell.
My research tackled failure that arises during the deployment of robot controllers,
ranging from offline preventive measures to online replanning.
